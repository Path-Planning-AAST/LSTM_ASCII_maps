F0309 00:58:03.456102 28018 softmax_loss_layer.cpp:47] Check failed: outer_num_ * inner_num_ == bottom[1]->count() (10 vs. 100) Number of labels must match number of predictions; e.g., if softmax axis == 1 and prediction shape is (N, C, H, W), label count (number of labels) must be N*H*W, with integer values in {0, 1, ..., C-1}.
