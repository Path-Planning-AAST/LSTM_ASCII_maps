MODIFICATION 5:
Considering the paradigm of time series problem for this task, it may be good to add to the input state 
the previous direction take:
	- TRAINING and VALIDATE phase: previous label direction
	- ONLINE TESTING phase: previous direction (action) taken by the net

Here in this folder there are net and snapshots from training process implementing this idea.


Lowering also number of layers, 7-128 maybe too much:
	3-128-drop is showing better result on: TRAINING 10240 VALIDATING 1024

Tests in this folder are also used to compare conventional structure - HERE - with channels (channeled) structure (see folder which name ends with "channeled-structure".

this folder will contain big test usaual sizes, 7-128-drop with previous dir added in input state
max path length = 300, complexity max = 750:

LOG: EPOCH 6/7
	convergence is normal, validation really bad.
